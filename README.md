4LW
===

4LW is a Base-27 virtual machine and corresponding stack, with the VM implemented in Haskell.

The 4LW's equivalent of a bit is a Letter, which can contain a space (Usually represented as an Underscore '_'), or an uncased character from A to Z

The 4LW has a word size of four (Hence the name, *4* *L*etter *W*ord), giving 531441 possible values per word.
This gives the 4LW a word size roughly eight times bigger than a 16 bit processor.

The exact spec has yet to be decided.
